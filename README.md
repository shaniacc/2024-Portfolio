# ðŸŒ¸ 2024-Portfolio 

This repository contains my 2024 portfolio project developed using Streamlit, as part of an assignment for our course. The project was created to familiarize ourselves with the various components and features of Streamlit, with an emphasis on creating a simple yet aesthetically pleasing autobiography and portfolio. ðŸ«§
